1. Introduction

The simECG software was developed for acting as an ECG simulator, for both
training and assessment purposes.
It has the ability to display several pre-defined rhythms for training purposes,
such as rhythm and conduction disturbances. Additionally, a number of settings
can be altered in order to create different training experiences for different
levels of user proficiency. With the release of this version, in Open Source
format, the authors putin practical application their ideal that education (and
training, in this case) should not be a commercial tool accessible to some but
rather a free collaborative tool available for those who seek knowledge.This
project will always be unfinished, and for that reason we count with your
comments and feedback to improve it. Please write you feedback by mail or place
in the forum.

    * Assess your knowledge

Additionally, in later versions, it will be possible to define certain
preferences such as calibration, filters, display and background as well as to
save/load your preferences and training settings.

3. Installation

The most recent binary releases are always maintained in the Sourceforge project page https://sourceforge.net/project/platformdownload.php?group_id=263385
Source code: The program can be compiled in any of the Qt4 supported platforms (http://www.qtsoftware.com/products), such as Apple Mac OS X among others. For those cases, you must have Qt4 development environment installed, and obtain the simECG source code.

simECG is released in binary format for the following platforms:

Linux platform binary
The released binary is inside a tar gzip file, and will require Qt shared libraries to run. Please make sure you have libqt4 installed in your computer.

Download Linux version from:
https://sourceforge.net/project/platformdownload.php?group_id=263385&sel_platform=16671

Windows platform binary
The simECG files are distributed inside a .zip file. Just unpack into a directory of your choice. There are no special requirements. In some special cases, you could need msvcrt.dll in order to run simECG.exe.

Download Windows version from:
https://sourceforge.net/project/platformdownload.php?group_id=263385&sel_platform=16670

From source code
You will need Qt version 4 developer libraries from your target platform in order to compile the source code. Just 'qmake' in the source code directory and a binary will be built. If you find any trouble during compilation for your platform, please contact the developers, or post questions and suggestions in the project developers mailing list.

Source code is available at:
http://sourceforge.net/scm/?type=svn&group_id=263385
