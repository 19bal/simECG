# This script is responsible for counting program builds.
#
# The counter is defined as a constant in the source code, in the
# format: "#define BUILDVERSION 0.12"
# It sets only the minor version number to the next integer.
#
# It runs before each compilation under qt-creator.
# In order to activate this script, you should configure build settings
# under Projects icon. Add a new "custom process step" in "build steps"
# and set it to call this script (command).

SOURCE=version.h

# Obtain current build number from source file
BUILD=`cat $SOURCE | grep "^#define BUILDVERSION" |  awk -F\" '{ print $2; }' | cut -d. -f2`

# Increment the BUILD variable
let "BUILD=$BUILD + 1"

# Insert the incremented value in the file main.cpp
sed -i -r "s/^#define BUILDVERSION \"([0-9]+)\.[0-9]+\"$/#define BUILDVERSION \"\1.$BUILD\"/" $SOURCE
